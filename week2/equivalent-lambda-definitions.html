//1 Given 'id1', is a1One a proper beta expansion of a2One?
const id1 = x1 => x1;

const a1One = y1 => id1(y1);

<!--
Check if a1One is a beta reduced form of a1One is equal to a2One, Steps:
1. declare a new const betaReduced1, that takes the a1One beta reduction
2. replace the y1 parameter in a1One with the const a2One
3. expression a1One should result in = id1(a2One)

4. later check with strict equality operator '===' if 'betaReduced1' is
   equal to a2One.
5. if 'true' than a1One is a proper beta expansion of a20ne-->

const betaReduced1 = a1One(a2One);

//Checker
document.writeln(betaReduced1 === a2One);
